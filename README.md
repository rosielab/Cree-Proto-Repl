This is the Repl made May-August 2021. It's hosted on Repl, and has audio-visual elements with lessons, tests, trivia, speech synth, and games.
The code, image folders, and everything else is in the zip file. 
Read more about the current state of the project in the Read Me file, and read more about future directions in the Cree Project Backlog spreadsheet.
